Ansible: 

It is the automation engine taht allows for agentless system configuration and deploymnet. 

Ansible operates on SSH and it is used to execute the commands, install softwares on remote or the local servers without any additional software but with just the basic ansible binary on the local. 

$ cat /proc/cpuinfo

install and configure ansible: 
    $ sudo yum install ansible
    $ sudo yum install git

    $ vi etc/ansible/ansible.conf

default inventory file is in here: $ /etc/ansible/hosts

ad-hoc command example: 

    $ ansible <hostname/hostgroup/hostip> -b -m <modulename> -a "name=<> value=<>"

    -b is for executing the command on root (become) 
    -m is for module name 
    -a is for the arguments of module 

playbooks:

    $ ansible-playbook -i <custominventoryfile> <playbookname.yml>

varibales: 

    $ ansible-playbook -i <custominventoryfile> <playbookname.yml> -e "service_name=httpd"

    either you can specify the varibale inside the playbook as below:

        vars: 
            service_name: httpd 
        tasks: 
            "{{ service_name }}"
            ## use double quotes and double curly braces to call the variable. 

ansible-facts: 

    by default the gathering facts will be true (yes) 
    
    you can restrict the playbook to not gather the fscts by below syntax: 
    
        gather_facts: no

    you can call the ansible_facts values directly in the playbook as the regular variable as below: 

        tasks: 
            "{{ ansible_hostname }}"

debug: 

    tasks: 
        - debug: 
            var: target_hosts

        register: task_debug
        - debug: 
            msg: "output of the line: {{ task_debug }}"
    
handlers: 

    handlers are similar to tasks but we can call handlers in different tasks as the module. 
    
        handlers: 
            task syntax 
            listen: "restart https"
            
        tasks: 
            notify: 
                - restart httpd
