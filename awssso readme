Overview of the AWS-SSO setup:
There are currently three directories responsible for helping connect the Ellucian Okta groups → AWS access in our main repo.   The  'MasterBilling-infra' dir is essentially the top-level directory of these three.   It is where you specify the relationship between Ellucian Okta groups to Identity Center Permission sets.
As an example, one module may creates the role and allows the 'OktaGroup1' OKTA group access to the account_type_OktaGRP1ou accounts.
The 'teamroles' and the 'iamsso' directories are used to create terraform modules.  You can update these modules by submitting PRs against their respective github repo.
'MasterBilling-infra' uses the module created by 'teamroles' to retrieve/update policies and then send these policies to the 'iamsso' module as parameters used to update/create roles in AWS accounts.
--------------------
MasterBilling-infra:
--------------------
This Directory is main Directory, Essentially the main repo that has the OKTA group names and Account IDs that calls the other modules in the other Directories to provision users. Used to call the modules below and contains the OKTA group → Account+role+policy mapping.
--------------------
TeamRoles:
--------------------
Used to create new policy documents.To be used when adjusting the policies assigned to a role.
Can Creates numerous:
Small policy documents with sets of permissions.
Larger policy documents for use by roles as their inline policy document are created by concatenating groups of the policy documents together.
--------------------
IAMSSO:
--------------------
Creates Identity Center Permissions sets, roles and account mappings
Used to create permission sets & Identity Center roles.
Probably will be changed rarely.
